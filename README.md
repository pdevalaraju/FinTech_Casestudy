# RegTech driving the future of Client Onboarding & KYC 

<h3>
Preamble
</h3>
Client onboarding is a process which users go through when they start their journey as a customer/client of a bank/financial institution. The onboarding experience can define the ongoing relationship the customer has with the organisation. Onboarding, as a term, is a misnomer. In truth, it refers less to a single process than to a series of processes. Continuous Client Onboarding, also known as Customer Lifecycle Management (CLM) extends the conception of onboarding from the capture and verification of client information and account funding to encompass the entire client lifecycle, from acquisition to reporting to termination. Reinforced Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) requirements for entities such as banks need to be implemented in the first stage of any business relationship when onboarding a new customer. 


<h3> Why this matters </h1>
Onboarding sets the tonne of the relationship
Client onboarding is the first touch point where the customer interacts with the financial institution. so it is essential to deliver a g ood experience to start the relationship on a postive note. the loss of customer during onboarding due to bad customer experience has impacted financial institutions's bottom line by approximately $10 billion a year. despite the critical importance of onboarding, one-third of the financial institutions surveyed have not invested in technology to help immprove the process. 

<ul>
    <li>
    According to a research done by Thomson Reuters, 92% of firms estimated that current know your customer (KYC) onboarding processes cost roughly around $28.5 million. It is a huge cost. 

<li>
    As per KPMG report, banks globally paid more than $15 billion for regulatory violations of client onboarding gaps.

<li>
    Fintech companies are putting a lot of pressure by providing seamless digital experience forcing financial institutions to re-assess their customer experience, thus forcing them to move towards global CLM technology, which not only ensures compliance, improves customer experience and makes processes operationally efficient, but also drives revenue.

<li>
    As per McKinsey, for every one-point increase in customer onboarding satisfaction on a ten-point Net Promoter Score (NPS) scale, there was a 3% increase in customer revenue. The fiscal implications of this can add up quickly: if a company onboarded $500 million worth of new customers last year and improved its onboarding satisfaction score from a five to a six on the scale, that would equate to an additional $15 million per year. A five- to eight-point improvement will result in earning additional $45 million per year just from by improving the customer onboarding process which is a HUGE additional amount.
</ul>

Hence, one of the critical areas where a financial institution thinks it can be a differentiator is on the onboarding & KYC process.

This case study discusses one such emerging RegTech solutions provider, Fenergo whose services speak to a lot of the headaches that banks have to deal with in the new era of digital banking. That includes a host of regulatory requirements; client lifecycle management (onboarding and making digital interfaces usable); and rolling out digital interfaces for the services that banks typically offer (corporate/institutional banking, asset management, private banking and wealth management); as well as client and regulatory technology for financial services.

Instead of Consolidating all the market data into a snapshot the below report focuses primarily on the first and foremost aspect of CLM - KYC, AML and PEP aspects of RegTech. 

### Solution segment to hold a larger market size

Currently, the market for software and services related to KYC, AML, and PEP is around $5.6 billion. However, this is forecasted to grow to at least $12 billion by the year 2022, according to a study performed by OWI Labs. This means that the market for these services will grow by nearly $2 billion per year for the next three years, eventually more than doubling in size

The global Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solution market size is projected to grow from USD 1.5 billion in 2019 to USD 3.6 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 19.5% during the forecast period.  Various factors such as the exponential rise in money laundering and terrorist financing activities and huge monetary losses owing to these activities in the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sector, are expected to drive the market. However, a lack of awareness among organizations about the importance of AML solutions and lack of skilled AML professionals may restrain market growth

The global AI in Fintech market was estimated at USD 6.67 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach USD 22.6 billion by 2025. The market is also expected to witness a CAGR of 23.37% over the forecast period (2020-2025). Increasing demand for process automation among financial organizations is driving the market. Process automation is one of the major drivers of artificial intelligence in financial organizations

### <i>What have been the major Trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5 -10 years?
</i>

Onboarding and KYC operational processes have had to change significantly over the last 10 years as regulatory requirements and customer expectations have changed. Long gone are the days of financial institutions being able to rely on relationship managers “knowing” who their customers are, and where they got their wealth. The financial industry has had to grow up to create a robust, up-to-date, auditable view of the customer. 

![Scope of Onboarding](https://github.com/pdevalaraju/FinTech_Casestudy/blob/master/Resources/onlboarding.png)

The current landscape of onboarding and KYC across the financial services industry, whether we are talking about institutional, commercial or retail customers, is a real hotchpotch of manual, legacy, and third-party processes, combined with technology “fixes” implemented usually to drive down cost and headcounts numbers, or to plug a gap identified in a regulatory or internal audit review. Until fairly recently, the strategies for onboarding and KYC have focused on local rather than global solutions and have been built for a particular business line or product.

<ul>
<li> Financial Institutions are realizing that putting the customer at the center of everything they do is the key to creating a sustainable, cost-effective, regulatory compliant environment where customers choose to stay, feeling part of a partnership. 
</li>
<li>From a process point of view, banks are applying case management principles, linking the CRM front office systems, with the back-office KYC processes seamlessly and transparently.  
</li>
<li>
From a regulatory compliance point of view, banks are now able to create consistency of KYC risk assessments across their business lines and jurisdictions, re-using and sharing information, maintaining a common standard, and being able to satisfy the needs of the various local regulators through applying local regulatory rules on top of a global minimum standard where necessary.
</li>
<li>
As regulations become stricter with ever evolving and introduction of new directives, eg. The fifth Anti Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) came into effect on 10 January 2020, setting out a new set of rules to help financial entities protect against the risks of money laundering and financing of terrorism, it is in a company’s best interest to be compliant. One way to do this is through the adoption of new technologies. These technologies aim to simplify the AML process. They also aim to simplify the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, which is a part of AML. Technology offers a way to address many of the pain points in current AML procedures.
</li>
</ul>

As the Regtech industry evolved, many players emerged providing Financial institutions with the ability to implement change quickly and smoothly, with minimal business disruption. Today, There are lots of vendors out there offering solutions to all or part of the challenges.  AI, RPA, DPA, Blockchain, NLP, Pattern Recognition, Semantic Engines, Machine Learning, automated Identity verification, Rules engines, zero code, low code, and configuration are all buzzwords in our current vocabulary.

## Recommendations

### <i>If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
</i>


Fenergo has been leveraging bleeding edge technologies already in their solutions and is focused to accelerate the digital transformation keeping up with the technology trends. The opportunities offered by these new technologies include:  

means of identifying a customer, most of it already been leveraged in their solutions:
<ui>
<Li> <b>Artificial intelligence (AI) </b> – technology by which the computer software can make decisions which are normally made by humans. For example, PayPal has cut its false fraud alerts in half, by using an AI monitoring system that can identify benign reasons for seemingly bad behavior. Others, like HSBC are, too, moving towards AI, pledging $2.3 billion to digital transformation and AI tech.</li>

<Li> <b> Blockchain </b> – KYC can use the convenience/security of distributed ledger tech (DLT) like blockchain, allowing users to manage their digital identity securely, while businesses and financial institutions can manage customer data reliably and easily. In Singapore, a consortium of OCBC Bank, HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), along with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), has become the first in South-East Asia to develop a prototype of a blockchain-based KYC solution.</li>
<Li> <b> Digital identities </b>– a unique electronic identifier that verifies that you are who you say you are. This is underpinned by Singapore’s Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Regulations 2016 and would promote interoperability and transparency across entities within the country.</li>
<Li> <b> Biometrics </b>– an inherent characteristic to recognise an individual based on his/her physical or behavioral traits (i.e. iris scanning, fingerprint, voice recognition, face ID). This has already been introduced by some of the big banks (e.g. OCBC, Maybank and BBVA), but is yet to gain widespread acceptance. iPhone X comes with Face ID and claims only one out of one million can be duplicated. I will not be surprised if it becomes industry standard soon.</li>
<Li> <b> Strong customer authentication </b>– authentication is based on a combination of a customer’s knowledge (passwords, sign or code), possession (mobile device, rings, or even keys), and biometric (iris, fingerprint, voice).</li>
<Li> <b> Data collaboration </b>- according to Chartis RiskTech100 Research 2015, 71% of respondents agreed that there is a compelling business case for integrating some or all of their anti-fraud and anti-money laundering (AML) systems into a single technology environment. Hopefully with this financial institutions will be able to mix internal and external client data to gain greater insights about a client. Well, I am not saying it will remove an onboarding process, but I hope that with such collaborations we can make the advantage of collective knowledge to provide a good customer experience by streamlining the process. </li>
</ul>

### <i> Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? </i>

Being a well established player and regarded as one the top RegTech companies, Fenergo has well laid out plan for acccelerating digital transofrmation. Personally, I might be aware of Fenergo’s plans to be able to comment if there are any areas I could suggest.
<ul>
<li> Fenergo is busy infusing its Client Lifecycle Management software solutions with intelligent technologies like Machine Learning and Robotic Process Automation to deliver a better client experience across the lifecycle.
<li> Fenergo Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions suite enable financial institutions to further automate routine Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, dramatically improving operational efficiencies and resource utilization.</li>

</ul>

From their blogs and recent publications, it is uunderstood that Fenergo has been working on the following: 
<ul>
<li> Core Banking Up/Downstream Integrations:  RPA is helping to further automate ‘swivel-chair’ activities across disconnected applications (e.g. legacy applications) such as downstream integrations with core banking systems.</li>
<li> Hierarchy Manager: In early 2019, Fenergo officially launched its new Hierarchy Manager solution, which delivers enhanced performance, data capture, visualization and interactions across the client lifecycle.</li>
<li> Document Automation: Machine Learning is helping to auto-classify data, document types and meta-data.  It can enhance data capture, extraction from documentation and processing e.g.populating fields with data obtained by either Optical Character Recognition (OCR) / Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR).</li>
<li> Document Understanding: Both Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NL) technologies are helping to automate the interpretation and translation of unstructured documents into structured data (e.g. hierarchy data sources, annual reports, funds prospectus, ISDA docs etc.).</li>
<li> AML Screening: Machine Learning is helping to lower the number of False Positive hits in the screening process through probabilistic matching algorithms and supervised learning.</li> 
</ul>

### <i> Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?


<b> Machine Learning (ML) </b> is an application of artificial intelligence (AI). It is a statistical process that enables software to learn through finding patterns in data. ML can be supervised (users provide feedback/validation) or unsupervised (tries to identify patterns by itself) to improve accuracy. ML can enhance evidence-based learning to make smarter, more informed decisions. It also delivers greater business efficiencies through reduced risk, improved accuracy and improved productivity, and enables financial institutions to discover new insights across data silos.

<b> Robotic Process Automation (RPA) </b> is the use of software robots to do basic tasks across applications just as human workers do. The software robot can be programmed to follow a workflow with multiple steps and applications. RPA enables financial institutions to automate repetitive, non-value adding and data intensive tasks, giving employees back time to focus on higher value client-centric activities whilst improving accuracy, reducing risks, and reducing total cost of ownership.

## Conclusion

### Acccelerate Digital Transformation for optimized customer experience across the lifecycle.

To stay competetive, financical institutions must leverage the disruptive technologies and digitalize their business to create streamlined ccustomer experience, stay compliant with regulations and optimize their operations. Companies like Fenergo have been successfully demonstrating the ROI and improved customer experiences. Transformation is an ongoing process with ever changing t echnology landscape and introduction of new solutions and Organizations have to continuously innovate and implement solutions that would further optimize customer experiences.
